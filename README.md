## About
Dots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players (also it can be played versus a computer). It was first published in the 19th century by French mathematician Édouard Lucas, who called it la pipopipette. It has gone by many other names, including the game of dots.

## How to Play
* The two players take turns joining two horizontally or vertically adjacent dots by a line.
* The player who completes the fourth side of a square (a box) puts his/her initials inside and gets another turn.
* When all the dots have been made into boxes, the player with the most boxes wins.
